<br />

# Why?

I created this command as sort of my portfolio that can be accessed from any terminal with Node.js. I was very curious to see if such a thing could be accomplished and it turned out to be quite easy in the end.

<br />
<br />

# Run.

Assuming you have Node.js installed, to run this command, simply do.

```sh
npx mustansir
```

<br />
<br />

# Bonus.

You can use this repository to make your name as an npx command! To do this following the instructions:

-   Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/MustansirZia/mustansir.npx.git`.
-   Open `src/config.json` and change the variables for name, bio, github username, etc. to your own. There's a bunch of other stuff you can change there as well.
-   Open `package.json` and change `name` field to whatever you wish the command to be.
-   Inside the same file, change `version` field to `1.0.0`.
-   Login into your npm account using the cli `npm login`. (You might want to create an npm account if you don't have one)
-   Publish your npx command using `npm publish`.
-   Make everyone else think you're cool by telling them to type `npx <YOUR_NAME>` where `<YOUR_NAME` is the `name` field in your `package.json`.
-   Show some love and star this repo. :)
